# TicTacToe
Example of developing a TicTacToe board game using TDD

### Why
The idea for this project started during a virtual coding interview. I am running a large global development team and decided the best way for me 
to determine if that works for me is to go through the interview myself. It was quite interesting and one of the live coding assessment was to create 
a TicTacToe board game. Don't get me wrong - when the problem description came up with a time limit of _15 minutes_ - I did what probably most did - 
better start 'hacking' away ...

### What is wrong with that ...

I am a big believer and practionier of Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin and the principles laid out in [CleanCoders](https://cleancoders.com) as well as 
[Working Effectivly with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052) from Michael Feathers.

This repository will track the step-by-step implementation, refactoring, Test Driven Development for this project along with a coding session screen recording. It will be longer than 15 minutes, but I am convinced the outcome will be more usable.
